# ToDoListWebsite

Check out the website at: https://miltonchung.github.io/ToDoListWebsite/

A simple project that I can learn and practice basic JavaScript like DOM manipulations, making the 
website more interactive, and displaying only the searched items/ordering them. I also used this 
opportunity to reinforce my HTML/CSS.
